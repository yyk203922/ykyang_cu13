By midnight Oct. 6, all of the paintings were supposed to have been sold off, under orders from Florida's comptroller, whose office regulates the state's S&Ls. CenTrust didn't meet the deadline.   The collection was at the heart of a grandiose plan Mr. Paul had in which the art was to do double duty -- as an investment for CenTrust and as decoration for the S&L's new office tower, designed by I.M. Pei. The rub is that the $28 million was plucked from the funds of this federally insured institution even as CenTrust was losing money hand over fist. Mr. Paul had no right to buy art for the S&L in the first place -- it isn't on the comptroller's \"permissible\" list -- without seeking a special dispensation, which he did not do.
