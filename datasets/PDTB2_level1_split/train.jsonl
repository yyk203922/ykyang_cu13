{"arg1": "From a reading of the somewhat scant English-language medical literature on RU-486, the French abortion pill emerges as one of the creepiest concoctions around", "arg2": "This is not only because it kills the unborn, a job at which it actually is not outstandingly efficient, zapping only 50% to 85% of them depending on which study you read (prostaglandin, taken in conjunction with the pill, boosts the rate to 95%).By contrast, surgical abortion is 99% effective. Abortion via the pill is far more of an ordeal than conventional surgical abortion.It is time-consuming (the abortion part alone lasts three days, and the clinical part comprises a week's worth of visits), bloody (one woman in a Swedish trial required a transfusion, although for most it resembles a menstrual period, with bleeding lasting an average of 10 days), and painful (many women require analgesic shots to ease them through).Nausea and vomiting are other common side effects. Timing is of the essence with RU-486.It is most effective taken about a week after a woman misses her menstrual period up through the seventh week of pregnancy, when it is markedly less effective.That is typically about a three-week window. So far, all the studies have concluded that RU-486 is \"safe.\" But \"safe,\" in the definition of Marie Bass of the Reproductive Health Technologies Project, means \"there's been no evidence so far of mortality.\" No one has researched the long-term effects of RU-486 on a woman's health or fertility. The drug seems to suppress ovulation for three to seven months after it is taken.Some women clearly have no trouble eventually conceiving again: The studies have reported repeaters in their programs.But there are no scientific data on this question. Rather ominously, rabbit studies reveal that RU-486 can cause birth defects, Lancet, the British medical journal, reported in 1987.However, Dr. Etienne-Emile Baulieu, the French physician who invented RU-486, wrote in a Science magazine article last month that the rabbit-test results could not be duplicated in rats and monkeys.The drug has a three-dimensional structure similar to that of DES, the anti-miscarriage drug that has been linked to cervical and vaginal cancer in some of the daughters of the women who took it", "relation": "Contingency"}

Other provisions have a more subtle, but nonetheless real and detrimental effect on the international position of U.S. exchanges.These include the extension of liability into areas beyond those established by judicial precedent and the expansion of liability to include punitive damages. In addition to increasing costs as a result of greater financial exposure for members, these measures could have other, far-reaching repercussions. One section of the bill would make all commodity brokerage firms and floor brokers liable for damages without willful misconduct.Nowhere in the federal securities law is simple negligence or inadvertent action a source of liability under similar circumstances. It is only logical to assume that the enactment of this provision will lead to increased litigation.In an already low-profitmargin business, commodity brokerage firms may well decide to eliminate the risk and expense of dealing with the retail public, depriving the private individual of access to the markets. Another measure makes commodity brokerage firms liable for violations committed by independent floor brokers who execute trades for them.This untried concept would expose these firms to potentially astronomical punitive damages. Faced with the virtually impossible task of supervising the execution of each trade, many commodity brokerage firms are likely to stop doing business with independents and instead hire their own salaried floor brokers.This would force out of business many of the individuals and small firms that function as floor brokers.A consequence of their departure could be a serious diminution of market liquidity. Finally, under the bill, a number of legitimate, longstanding business practices would be arbitrarily banned, unless the CFTC were to take specific and timely action to permit them to continue.In other words, regulation will occur through inaction and happenstance, rather than through a normal deliberative procedure. The affected practices include the placing of oral orders, which is the way most public customer orders are placed, and trading between affiliated brokers, even though in some cases trading with affiliates may be the only way to obtain the best execution for a client.Also precluded would be dual trading, whereby a broker trades for customers as well as his own account, a practice that provides needed liquidity to the markets", "relation": "Expansion"}
